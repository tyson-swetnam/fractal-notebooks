    "## What is Diffusion Limited Aggregation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA)** is a stochastic growth model first described by Witten and Sander in 1981. The algorithm simulates how particles undergoing random walks (Brownian motion) aggregate to form clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Seed Placement**: Start with one or more \"seed\" particles fixed in position\n",
    "2. **Particle Release**: Release a new particle from a random position (typically far from the cluster)\n",
    "3. **Random Walk**: The particle performs a random walk (moves randomly in all directions)\n",
    "4. **Aggregation**: When the particle touches the existing cluster, it \"sticks\" and becomes part of the structure\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Continue releasing particles until the desired cluster size is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why DLA Produces Fractals\n",
    "\n",
    "DLA produces self-similar fractal structures because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Particles on random walks are more likely to contact the outer \"tips\" of branches (screening effect)\n",
    "- Interior regions are \"shielded\" from incoming particles\n",
    "- This leads to runaway growth at branch tips, creating dendritic (tree-like) structures\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting structures have a **fractal dimension** of approximately 1.7 in 2D, meaning they fill space in a way intermediate between a line (dimension 1) and a plane (dimension 2)."

    "## Mathematical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Walk\n",
    "\n",
    "A particle at position $(x, y)$ moves according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{t+1} = x_t + \\Delta x, \\quad y_{t+1} = y_t + \\Delta y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ are random displacements (typically +/-1 in a discrete lattice model).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sticking Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "We can modify the aggregation behavior using a **sticking probability** $p_s$. A particle touching the cluster only sticks with probability $p_s$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p_s = 1.0$: Dense, compact clusters (standard DLA)\n",
    "- $p_s < 1.0$: More branched, wispy structures (particles penetrate deeper before sticking)\n",

    "### Directional Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing bias in the random walk direction, we can simulate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Upward growth** (like bryophytes reaching for light): higher probability of upward movement\n",
    "- **Radial growth** (like lichens): particles released from edges, aggregating toward center\n",

Lichens: Radial Symbiotic Growth\n\n### Biological Context\n\n**Lichens** are composite organisms arising from symbiosis between fungi and photosynthetic partners (algae or cyanobacteria). They represent a remarkable example of mutualism where the fungal partner (mycobiont) provides structure and protection while the photosynthetic partner (photobiont) provides carbohydrates through photosynthesis.\n\nLichens display a remarkable diversity of growth forms, which can be arranged according to their evolutionary development:\n\n$$\\text{Leprose} \\rightarrow \\text{Crustose} \\rightarrow \\text{Placodioid} \\rightarrow \\text{Squamulose} \\rightarrow \\text{Foliose} \\rightarrow \\text{Fruticose}$$\n\n### Lichen Growth Forms\n\n#### 1. Leprose Lichens (Pioneer Form)\n**Structure**: A diffuse, powdery mass of fungal hyphae and algal cells with minimal organization.\n\n- No cortex layer (ecorticate)\n- Undifferentiated tissue throughout\n- Name derives from Latin *leprosus* (\"scurfy\" or \"scaly\")\n\n**DLA Model**: Represents early-stage aggregation with very low particle density:\n$$\\rho(r) \\sim r^{-\\alpha}, \\quad \\alpha \\approx 0.3$$\n\nwhere $\\rho(r)$ is the particle density at radius $r$ from the origin.\n\n#### 2. Crustose Lichens\n**Structure**: Thin crust growing directly on or embedded within the substrate; cannot be removed without destroying the substrate.\n\n- Upper cortex only (no lower cortex)\n- May be areolate (divided into islands by cracks)\n- Thickness typically 0.1-1 mm\n\n**Growth Model**: Radial expansion rate proportional to perimeter:\n$$\\frac{dA}{dt} = k \\cdot P(t)$$\n\nwhere $A$ is area, $P$ is perimeter, and $k$ is a growth constant. For circular growth:\n$$r(t) = r_0 + kt$$\n\n#### 3. Placodioid Lichens\n**Structure**: A specialized crustose form with distinctive lobed margins radiating from a central areolate region.\n\n- Upper cortex present, no lower cortex\n- Only the marginal lobes grow; central region contains reproductive structures\n- Radial expansion from center\n\n**Growth Model**: Growth concentrated at the margin with angular dependence:\n$$\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial t} = v_0 \\cdot f(\\theta) \\cdot g(r)$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle, $f(\\theta)$ represents angular variation creating lobes, and $g(r)$ decreases with radius as resources become limiting.\n\n#### 4. Foliose Lichens\n**Structure**: Leaf-like thalli with flat, lobed sheets that are loosely attached to the substrate.\n\n- Both upper and lower cortex present\n- Rhizines (hyphal bundles) anchor to substrate\n- Lobes typically 1-20 mm wide\n\n**Structural Dimensions**: The thallus thickness $h$ scales with lobe width $w$:\n$$h \\sim w^{\\beta}, \\quad \\beta \\approx 0.6-0.8$$\n\n**DLA Simulation**: Classic radial DLA with standard sticking probability $p_s = 1.0$\n\n#### 5. Fruticose Lichens\n**Structure**: Three-dimensional, shrubby or pendulous growth with cylindrical or flattened branches.\n\n- Single cortex surrounding the entire branch\n- Concentric internal organization: cortex → photobiont layer → medulla (center)\n- No distinct upper/lower surface\n\n**Branch Geometry**: Cross-sections are approximately circular with radius $\\rho$:\n$$A_{cross} = \\pi \\rho^2$$\n\n**Branching Model**: Follows Horton's laws of stream ordering:\n$$N_k = R_b^{(K-k)}$$\n\nwhere $N_k$ is the number of branches of order $k$, $K$ is the highest order, and $R_b \\approx 3-5$ is the bifurcation ratio.\n\n#### 6. Basidiolichens\n**Structure**: Rare lichens where the fungal partner is a basidiomycete rather than the typical ascomycete.\n\n- May form mushroom-like fruiting bodies\n- Basidiospores produced in basidia rather than ascospores in asci\n- Primarily found in tropical regions\n\n**Reproductive Model**: Spore release follows:\n$$N_{spores}(t) = N_0 \\cdot e^{-\\lambda t}$$\n\nwhere $N_0$ is initial spore count and $\\lambda$ is the dispersal rate.\n\n### DLA Simulation Approach\n\nWe'll simulate **foliose lichen** growth (the most classic DLA pattern):\n\n- Start with a **central seed point** \n- Release particles from a **circular boundary** (representing available substrate)\n- Use **unbiased random walks** for isotropic growth\n- Sticking probability controls lobe density vs. branching\n\nThe fractal dimension of the resulting structure:\n$$D_f \\approx 1.71 \\pm 0.01 \\text{ (2D DLA)}$$"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored **Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA)** as a model for understanding natural fractal growth patterns. We demonstrated how simple modifications to the basic DLA algorithm can simulate diverse biological structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Organism | Growth Pattern | Key Parameters | Fractal Character |\n",
    "|----------|---------------|----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Stromatolite** | Layered, dome-like | Downward bias, horizontal seed | Stacked, branching columns |\n",
    "| **Bryophyte** | Branching, vertical | Upward bias, low sticking | Dendritic, tree-like |\n",
    "| **Lichen** | Radial, spreading | Isotropic, central seed | Classic DLA dendrites |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple rules create complexity**: DLA demonstrates how complex fractal structures emerge from simple random processes\n",
    "2. **Bias shapes structure**: Directional biases in random walks dramatically change the resulting morphology\n",
    "3. **Sticking probability controls branching**: Lower sticking probabilities create more branched, penetrating structures\n",
    "4. **Universal patterns**: Despite different biology, many natural structures share underlying DLA-like growth mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Try modifying the simulations to explore:\n",
    "- Multiple seed points (colony formation)\n",
    "- Time-varying parameters (changing environmental conditions)\n",
    "- 3D DLA simulations\n",
    "- Adding nutrients or resource gradients"
