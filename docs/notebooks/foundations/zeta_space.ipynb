    "1. **Run in a Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "   - The interactive widgets require an environment that supports `ipywidgets`.\n",
    "   - Ensure you have `ipywidgets` installed:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     pip install ipywidgets\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     And enable widgets extensions:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interactive Controls:**\n",
    "   - **Shape Types:** Use the `SelectMultiple` widget to choose one or more shapes ('Circle', 'Square', 'Triangle').\n",
    "   - **Plane Area (`A_plane`):** Adjust the total area of the plane to be filled.\n",
    "   - **Initial Area (`A0`):** Set the area of the initial shape.\n",
    "   - **Exponent (`p`):** Modify the exponent in the decreasing function \\( g(i) \\).\n",
    "   - **Number of Shapes (`n_shapes`):** Set the maximum number of shapes to attempt to place.\n",
    "   - **Max Particle Size (`max_particle_size`):** Specify the maximum size for the shapes.\n",
    "   - **Random Orientation (`random_orientation`):** Toggle random rotations for squares and triangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Updates:**\n",
    "   - Adjust the controls to see the tiling update in real-time.\n",
    "   - Observe how changing parameters affects the placement, size, and types of shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the New Features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Multiple Shape Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implementation:**\n",
    "  - Changed `shape_type` to `shape_types`, which is a list of selected shape types.\n",
    "  - Used a `SelectMultiple` widget to allow multiple selections.\n",
    "  - When assigning areas to shapes, the code randomly selects a shape type from the chosen list for each shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**\n",
    "  - Allows you to include a mix of shapes in the tiling.\n",
    "  - Adds diversity and complexity to the patterns generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Random Shape Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assignment of Areas:**\n",
    "  - The areas calculated are shuffled to distribute different sizes among the shapes.\n",
    "  - For each area, a shape type is randomly selected from the chosen list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Placement and Drawing:**\n",
    "  - The code handles the drawing of each shape according to its type.\n",
    "  - Overlap checking is adjusted to account for different shape types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Overlap Checking Adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mixed Shapes:**\n",
    "  - The `is_overlapping` function is updated to handle different shape types.\n",
    "  - Shapes are approximated as circles for overlap checking to simplify collision detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Radius Calculation:**\n",
    "  - For circles, the radius is straightforward.\n",
    "  - For squares and triangles, the code calculates an equivalent radius by approximating the shape's bounding circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shuffle Areas:**\n",
    "  - Shuffling the list of areas ensures that sizes are randomly distributed among the shapes, preventing patterns where certain shapes only have large or small sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shape-Specific Parameters:**\n",
    "  - You can further customize the properties of each shape type if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Considerations:**\n",
    "  - As the complexity increases with multiple shapes, the computation time may also increase.\n",
    "  - The code includes a maximum number of attempts to place each shape to prevent infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualization:**\n",
    "  - The plot title dynamically updates to reflect the selected shape types.\n",
    "  - Colors and styles are set differently for each shape type to distinguish them visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selecting All Shapes:**\n",
    "  - By default, all shapes are selected, resulting in a tiling that includes circles, squares, and triangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selecting Specific Shapes:**\n",
    "  - You can select only 'Circle' and 'Square' to exclude triangles.\n",
    "  - Alternatively, select a single shape type to focus on that shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjusting Parameters:**\n",
    "  - Modify the exponent `p` to see how it affects the size distribution.\n",
    "  - Change the maximum particle size to limit the size of the largest shapes.\n",
    "  - Toggle random orientation to see the difference between aligned and randomly rotated shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `ipywidgets`) and that you are running the code in an environment that supports interactive widgets.\n",
