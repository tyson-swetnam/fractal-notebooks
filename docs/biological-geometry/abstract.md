## Architectures of the Infinite: Self-Affine Fractals, Complex Dimensions, and the Thermodynamic Geometries of Biological Space-Filling

Biological organisms face an existential geometric problem: maximize the capture of diffuse resources while minimizing the metabolic cost of tissue construction. This chapter examines how evolution has solved this optimization through self-affine fractal architectures rather than simple self-similar structures. We extend the West-Brown-Enquist (WBE) model of allometric scaling to incorporate complex dimensions arising from finite-scale fractality, demonstrating that the anisotropic scaling of vascular networks---where radial dimensions scale as \( \beta_r = n^{-1/2} \) and longitudinal dimensions as \( \beta_l = n^{-1/3} \)---represents the geometric solution to competing demands of hydraulic efficiency and mechanical stability.

We analyze three principal mechanisms of biological space-filling: (1) deterministic Iterated Function Systems (IFS) exemplified by fern architecture, where four affine transformations encode an algorithm for optimizing photosynthetic surface area; (2) stochastic Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) governing lichen, algae, and kelp morphogenesis, where harmonic measure screening creates dendritic structures with fractal dimension \( D \approx 1.6-1.7 \); and (3) competitive packing algorithms including crown shyness (Voronoi tessellations) and Apollonian circle packing that dictate forest canopy organization.

The chapter synthesizes these observations through spectral geometry and complex fractal dimensions, interpreting the log-periodic oscillations observed in biological growth data not as noise but as signatures of discrete scale invariance. These oscillations, governed by complex dimensions \( \mathcal{D} = \{D + i\frac{2\pi k}{\ln \gamma}\} \), connect biological morphogenesis to the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. We propose that organisms function as "zeta function machines" whose growth computes the zeros of their own spectral geometry, with stable morphologies representing eigenstates where oscillations constructively interfere. This framework unifies the shape of leaves, growth rhythms, and phyllotactic patterns under the thermodynamic geometry of life.
