## Abstract

Much of the scientific literature describes the fractal-like hierarchical branching networks of vascular organisms as 'self-similar'. Here we examine papers where fractal-like self-similarity is incorrectly described. We also link why the hierarchical branching networks in vascular organisms are 'self-affine' rather than self-similar by linking metabolic scaling theory to these structural traits. Last, we propose a mechanistic theory of fractal dimensions for single cell through multicellular life forms.

In our supplemental materials, we provide empirical explanations for the fractal-like structures of single cell colonies and autotrophs including primitive algae, vascular organisms including lichens and bryophytes, and higher order terrestrial plants.

We also describe how self-affinity arises in heterotrophs as related to metabolic and circulatory networks.

## Key Findings

1. **Dimensional analysis with appropriate self-affine mass dimension** shows that many reported fractal dimensions in ecology are either incorrect or inappropriately reported.

2. **A technique for testable predictions**, including a mechanistic explanation for how individual branching networks grow and fill space and how communities of organisms emerge with fractal dimensions based on MST predictions.

3. **Self-affine vs self-similar**: The distinction between these concepts has significant implications for how we measure and interpret fractal dimensions in biological systems.
